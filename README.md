# What's different from the other autosplitter?

This autosplitter is real time and only pauses when the game is loading. 

The other autosplitter (https://github.com/10-days-till-xmas/Shady-Knight-autosplitter) is IGT and only runs whenever the in-game timer runs.

There's also another split for breaking the door in the final hallway at the very end of the game as well as an auto reset function.

# Auto reset

Livesplit will automatically reset an uncompleted run upon entering the main menu.

You can disable this as follows: 

Right click LiveSplit -> Edit splits -> Settings (under attempts) -> Uncheck "Autoreset".
